# A world full of integrations 🌐

Hi, I'm Anton, and a warm welcome to my page about integrations! 🚀

I've had the luxury of working closely with business processes, and therefore, I have naturally been supporting and developing integrations! Currently, I work as an Integration Developer at [Epical](https://www.epicalgroup.com) with a focus on Microsoft Integration Services. 💼

The goal of this blog is to inspire and help other developers working with integrations. The content on this blog will be focused on Microsoft Integration Services; however, CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and DevOps are the same, whatever platform you are working with! 🔗💻
