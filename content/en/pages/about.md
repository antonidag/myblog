# A world full of integrations 🌐

Hi, I'm Anton, and a warm welcome to my blog about the exciting topic of integrations! 🚀

My journey into integrations began with game development. I scripted simple games using the game engine [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en), which, in turn, led me to study Game Development at Malmö University. However, after realizing that there is much more fun in developing sorting algorithms, databases, and applications, I ended up changing my degree to a BSc in Computer Science instead! 🕹️📚

Since then, I've had the luxury of working closely with business processes, and therefore, I have naturally been supporting and developing integrations! Currently, I work as an Integration Developer at [Epical](https://www.epicalgroup.com/en) with a focus on Microsoft Integration Services. 💼

The goal of this blog is to inspire and help other developers working with integrations. The content on this blog will be focused on Microsoft Integration Services; however, CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and DevOps are the same, whatever platform you are working with! 🔗💻
