# A world full of integrations

Hi, I'm Anton, and a warm welcome to my blog about the exciting topic of integrations!

My journey into integrations began with game development. I scripted simple games using the game engine [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en), which, in turn, led me to study Game Development at Malmö University. However, after realizing that there is much more fun in developing sorting algorithms, databases, and applications, I ended up changing my degree to a BSc in Computer Science instead!

Since then, I've had the luxury of working closely with business processes, and therefore, I have naturally been supporting and developing integrations! Currently, I work as an Integration Developer at [Epical](https://www.epicalgroup.com/en) with a focus on Microsoft Integration Services.

The goal of this blog is to inspire and help other developers working with integrations. The content on this blog will be focused on Microsoft Integration Services; however, CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and DevOps are the same, whatever platform you are working with!
