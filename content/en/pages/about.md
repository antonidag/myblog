# A world full of integrations

Hi, I'am Anton and warm welcome to my blog about the exciting topic of integrations!

My journey forwards integrations started with game development. I scripted simple games using the game engine [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en), which in turn lead me to study Game Development at Malmö University. However, after realizing that there is much more fun to develop sorting algos, databases and applications, I ended up changing my degree to a Bc in Computer Science instead!

Since then I have had a the **luxury** of working close to business processes and therefor I have naturally been supporting and developed integrations!
As of now I work as an Integration Developer at [Epical](https://www.epicalgroup.com/en) with the focus on Microsoft Integration Services.

My goal of this blog is inspire and help out other developers working with integrations. The content on this blog will be focused on the Microsoft Integration Services, however CI/CD, infrastructure as code and DevOps are the same whatever platform you are working with!
