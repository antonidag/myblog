## Background
Optimizing your Logic App for better performance is a hot topic, and there are many best practices and resources available. This blog  <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-integration-services-blog/using-inline-code-instead-of-a-foreach-loop-for-better/ba-p/3369587" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> from Microsoft explains that Inline Code could be used as an option instead of the For Each action for better performance. Therefor we will conduct a benchmark between the Logic App Standard actions For Each, Filter Array, and Inline Code in order to gain more insight into how the different actions perform!

## Exploring options for Loops üîÅ
Looping over an array of elements is fundamental in programming. In Logic Apps, this is typically performed by the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-control-flow-loops?tabs=consumption#foreach-loop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">For Each action</a>. However, there are many ways to interact with a collection, such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-add-run-inline-code?tabs=consumption" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inline Codde</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-liquid-transform?tabs=consumption" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liquid Transformation</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-perform-data-operations?tabs=consumption" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Operations</a>, and even <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/workflow-definition-language-functions-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expressions</a>. Some of these methods are more limited, while others offer greater flexibility depending on the logic you wish to implement. For example, if you want to filter a collection based on a property, the Filter action is a good option. On the other hand, if you want to reverse an array, you can simply use the `reverse` Expression.

### For Each action
This action allows you to loop over a collection. By default, iterations will run simultaneously in parallel. There are limitations related to the For Each action depending on whether you run Logic App Consumption or Standard. The devil is in the details, but generally, the For Each action can only loop over 100.000 items, with the concurrency set to 20 by default and a maximum of 50. Read more about the limitations <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config?tabs=consumption#looping-debatching-limits" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

### Filter Array action
The Filter array action is a part of the Data Operations family. It allows you to create a subset of items based on a criteria. The action takes a collection as input and can filter the array on a property equal to a specific value. The action cannot transform the output into a different format or alter any items; instead, these operations have to be done in later actions.

### Inline Code action
Allows you to run "vanilla" JavaScript code within Logic Apps and can be used for a vast variety of tasks. The action can utilize outputs from other actions and can also `return` the output of the code, which, in turn, can be used in other actions in your workflows.

## The Benchmark üìè
This benchmark focuses on a use case where there is a need to filter a collection and add a property to the remaining items. We will increase the number of elements by 500, starting at 500 and going up to 10.000 elements. The benchmark will be performed on three different implementations, each focusing on a different Logic App action:
- For Each with Condition action
- Filter Array with For Each action
- and Inline Code action

The files for this benchmark was generated by [dummy-data-cli](https://github.com/antonidag/dummy-data-cli). Its a tool built for generating dummy data based on JavaScript templates. The following template was used: 
```
export function main(index) {
    return `
    [
      {{#repeat ${index}}}
      {
        "id": {{@index}},
        "name": "{{firstName}} {{lastName}}",
        "work": "{{company}}",
        "email": "{{email}}",
        "dob": "{{date '1900' '2000' 'YYYY'}}",
        "address": "{{int 1 100}} {{street}}",
        "city": "{{city}}",
        "optedin": {{boolean}},
        "coordinates": {
          "x": {{float -50 50 '0.00'}},
          "y": {{float -25 25 '0.00'}}
        },
        "price": "$ {{int 0 99999 '0,0'}}",
        "status": "{{random 'active' 'inactive' 'paused' }}"
      }
      {{/repeat}}
    ]`
}
``` 

### Scenario Description:
1. **Read/Input Array**
2. **Loop Over Array:**
   - Once the array is retrieved, iterate over individual elements within the array.
3. **Conditional Handling:**
   - Filter out objects based on status equal to `active`
4. **Add/enrich elements with additional data**
  - Add `batchId` with a uuid string
5. **Return filtered array with enriched data**

The order of the operations is not necessarily needed to be followed, the important is that the input array is filtered and individual items are enriched with more data.

### Workflow implementation
For simplicity, all the workflows will return a `202 Accepted` to the client once a request is received, allowing the rest of the workflow to continue its execution and process the payload.

__For Each__ uses a Condition inside the For Each action:

__Filter Array__ uses the Filter Array before looping over the elements with a For Each action:

__Inline Code__ uses JavaScript to filter and loop over the collection:

### Environment settings
All the benchmarks will use the same resource setup:
- WS1 App Service Plan. The scale-out burst and minimum were set to 1 instance.
- Logic Apps Standard, with the scale-out setting set to 1 `Always Ready Instance`.
- Workflow mode was set to `Stateful` mode, and the concurrency settings remained at default, meaning that Logic App will process several elements simultaneously.

## Reflections

Before analyzing the results, it is important to mention that the results are not to be seen as good or bad; there are many factors to consider. For this benchmark, we only focused on the duration of the workflows.

A quick screening shows that the Inline Code implementation crushes its competition, being approximately `0.095 / 0.00049 ‚âà 194.0` __194__ times faster than the For Each implementation, and `0.067 / 0.00049 ‚âà 137.0` __137__ times faster than the Filter Array implementation. These metrics, and with an average time per element of __0.00049__ seconds, indicate that it is quite fast! Why do we get these results? One reason could be that the Inline Code action runs within a single execution context, minimizing the overhead associated with action-by-action processing.

Looking at the Filter Array implementation combined with the For Each action, it definitely falls a bit under the shadow when compared to the Inline Code implementation. The [time per element chart](#time-per-element-in-seconds) indicates some performance decrease as the number of elements grows. Compared to the For Each implementation, we can calculate that it is around `0.095 / 0.067 ‚âà 1.4` __1.4__ times faster.

Lastly, the elephant (literally) in the room is the For Each implementation. It had impressive stable performance regardless of the number of elements. Unfortunately, it performed the worst out of the three methods.

Does this mean you should always inject JavaScript everywhere whenever you can? Probably not, but it has its place when you need to iterate over large collections and other tasks that require a more programmatic approach. There are also limitations to consider before jumping on the JavaScript hype train.

Key take away from this benchmark is:
- If possible use the Filter Array action to only work with a subset of a collection. 
- Use JavaScript when you need to iterate a big collection, because its really fast!
- For Each action, really stable performance.

During the writing of this blog post, Microsoft announced <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-integration-services-blog/announcement-introducing-net-c-inline-action-for-azure-logic/ba-p/4160541" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Custom C# Code</a> for the Inline Code Action. I will do a benchmark on this as well once the documentation is a bit more comprehensive!
