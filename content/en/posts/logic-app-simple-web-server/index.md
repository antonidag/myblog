description: Logic App, a service designed for integrations and business processes. But in this post we will be transforming Logic Apps into a web experience by using server-side rendering (SSR).

## Background
Logic Apps is great tool for integrating business processes and can be used for multiple different use cases, however building a web pages is not one of them! Let's change that and build simple web app with [Logic Apps (Standard)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview).

Before we head into Logic App development I think it is important to understand the fundamentals of web servers, server side rendering and a little about response times! Because we need this to get fully functional web app.

### Web Server üíª
A simple way to explain a web server is a host that serves files to clients and that the communication between the client and server is done through the [HTTP protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP).
The client makes a request to web server, the web server can either response with the file or if something went wrong or an error occurred return a error response. [üìñ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_web_server)
This simple way of hosting webpages is normally referred to what's called a static site.

### Server Side Rendering
SSR often refers to when a webpage is generated each time a client requests it. In other words, a page returned to the client upon request is a server-side rendered webpage. Compared to static site where pages are pre-generated. [üìñ](https://dev.to/ebereplenty/server-side-rendering-ssr-vs-static-site-generation-ssg-214k)


### Response times 
When building web apps or anything user related, the less time a user waits the better it is. Response time is a measurement on how long it takes for the client to receive the requested content from the server. Response times that lie around 200ms, is a good reference point to have. [üìñ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_long_is_too_long)

There is a lot more to be said about these topics, however, I think a general understanding about the concepts will be enuf to continue.

## Turing Logic App into a web app üåê
As mentioned earlier, Logic Apps does not provide these features out of the box, but we can build it!‚öíÔ∏è

**How do we achieve this?**
1) Logic Apps provide built-in HTTP actions to both react on incoming request and return a response back to the client. This means that we somewhat have the basics of a web server. 
2) We also want to present dynamic content on our webpage. For this, we can use [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid), with [DotLiquid](https://github.com/dotliquid/dotliquid) being a .NET port of the popular open source project Liquid, and it comes as built-in action in Logic Apps. 
3) Logic Apps are perhaps not known for their fast operations, but in this case I believe Stateless workflows could be a good fit. [Stateless workflows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/single-tenant-overview-compare) is a type of Logic Apps workflow with less overhead and some other features, resulting in faster performance and quicker response times.

So we have a way to communicate with clients, present dynamic content and give fast response times, I believe we have the necessary tools to start building our web app!

**Creating a Logic App Web App**

For simplicity sakes we will build a simple web app to search and display movies using the [Open Movie Database API](https://www.omdbapi.com/). There will be two pages, Home and About section.  

Each page will live inside of a workflow. The workflow will start with the Response trigger "When a request is received" and end with an Response action back to the client. The last Response action need to return html code and have the http header ```Content-Type``` set to ```text/html```, otherwise the browser will not understand it correctly. In between the request and response action is where API calls and etc can be placed. 

Create base html liquid template: 
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>
<body>
<div class="container">
  <nav>
    <form class="d-flex" role="search" action="{{content.postUrl}}" method="post">
      <input type="search" placeholder="Search" name="search" aria-label=" minlength="2">
      <button type="submit">Search</button>
    </form>
  </nav>
  {{content.body}}
</div>
</body>
</html>
<!-- This is just the raw html, without styling-->
```
Take note on the `content.postUrl` that will be the url of the workflow that calls the omdb API, and the `content.body` is where we will display the result of the omdb API. 

Let's create a liquid template for the movie search results: 
```
{% for array in content.movies -%}
<div>
  {% for item in array -%}
  <div class="card">
    <img src="{{item.Poster}}" alt="{{item.Title}}" width="100px">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5>{{item.Title}}</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Year: {{item.Year}}</li>
        <li>Type: {{item.Type}}</li>
        <li>IMDB: #{{item.imdbID}}</li>
        <!-- omdb API has more properties that can be used, but for simplicity this will work-->
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  {%- endfor -%}
</div>
{%- endfor -%}
<!-- This is just the raw html, without styling-->
```
This template will take in an array of object and loop over each item and populate the html for us.

Now we can create our two workflows, one for our landing page and another when a user searches on a movie.

The home/landing workflow will have the following actions: 
![Workflow](workflow_home.gif)
We will just return the base liquid we created.

The search workflow will look something similar to this:
