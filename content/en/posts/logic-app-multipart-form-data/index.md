## Background 
The support for working with pain JSON, XML or text files is great in Logic Apps, however sometimes you need send a customized message or a request to a service, in some cases you need to be available handle a different content type than your typical JSON or XML payloads and those can be a bit more challenging. In this guide we will a specially look into the less used media content type  `multipart/form-data` payloads! 

## What is the Content-Type HTTP header? ðŸ“­
The `Content-type` HTTP header is used to describe the payload format. in the HTTP request and response so that the recevning side can decode/parse the payload correctly. There are many different content types, most commonly seen in REST APIs are usually `application/json` or `application/xml`. The `Content-Type` should not be confused with the encoding of the payload, the HTTP header `Content-Encoding` describes the applied encoding on the resource. 

### What is multipart/form-data?
So let's continue with the content type `multipart/form-data`, you will encounter this type of  content type, at least in my experience when working with HTML forms as for an example. The user needs to submit there first/last name and perhaps attach an file as well. There is probably many more implementations where the content type `multipart/form-data` is used, but just to give you feel where you might encounter this. 

Okey, but how does it look and work? Below is an example request of sending `multipart/form-data` from the Postman client: 
```
POST /anything HTTP/1.1
Host: httpbin.org
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=--------------------------671747156319508458970968
Content-Length: 506
 
----------------------------671747156319508458970968
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="Age"
30
----------------------------671747156319508458970968
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="FirstName"
Foo
----------------------------671747156319508458970968
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="LastName"
Bar
----------------------------671747156319508458970968
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="AdditionalInfo"
SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh
----------------------------671747156319508458970968--
```
This is the raw HTTP request taken from the Postman console, and one thing that stands out in the payload body, is that the body content is sent as a blocks of data. Each block is dived by the `boundary` value and is separating each block. As a part of each block there is a `Content-Disposition` header. This header must be a apart of a multipart body to give information about the field it is applied to. One thing important to mention is also that the value of `boundary` is user-defined, meaning that it is something that the sending party needs implement. In the example above you you see that we have four blocks; Age, FirstName, LastName and AdditionalInfo. Value of each "key" can be viewed under the `Content-Disposition` header, so for "Age" its `30`, "FirstName" equals `Foo` and so on.

## Multipart/form-data with Logic Apps
Now we pretty much know a bunch of things, but how does it work within Logic Apps? 
Logic Apps likes to talks in JSON, which can make things a bit confusing but let's break it down. 

Created a simple HTTP trigger workflow using Logic App Standard. If we post the same request describe in the section [What is multipart/form-data?](#what-is-multipartform-data) but now we instead call this workflow and look in trigger output, you will have something similar to this: 

```
// Some fields in the output has been removed for readablity. 
{
    "headers": {
        "Accept": "*/*",
        "Content-Length": "506",
        "Content-Type": "multipart/form-data; boundary=--------------------------493073486649885477988289"
    },
    "body": {
        "$content-type": "multipart/form-data; boundary=--------------------------493073486649885477988289",
        "$content": "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",
        "$multipart": [
            {
                "headers": {
                    "Content-Disposition": "form-data; name=\"FirstName\"",
                    "Content-Length": "3"
                },
                "body": {
                    "$content-type": "application/octet-stream",
                    "$content": "Rm9v"
                }
            },
            {
                "headers": {
                    "Content-Disposition": "form-data; name=\"LastName\"",
                    "Content-Length": "3"
                },
                "body": {
                    "$content-type": "application/octet-stream",
                    "$content": "QmFy"
                }
            },
            {
                "headers": {
                    "Content-Disposition": "form-data; name=\"Age\"",
                    "Content-Length": "2"
                },
                "body": {
                    "$content-type": "application/octet-stream",
                    "$content": "MzA="
                }
            },
            {
                "headers": {
                    "Content-Disposition": "form-data; name=\"AdditionalInfo\"",
                    "Content-Length": "12"
                },
                "body": {
                    "$content-type": "application/octet-stream",
                    "$content": "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```


This might look a bit cryptic in at first glance and as you noticed it does not entrily look like the raw HTTP request that was sent. But acually Logic Apps has already converted the payload into JSON format, and made things a bit easier for us. The blocks in the mulitpart-form data has been converted into array can be found in the `$multipart` property.  

If we break it down the triger output object:
- `$content` property contains the full body, its encoded with base64
- `$content-type` you can the boundary value
- `$multipart` this property continas and array with objects containg the data. In this case the body property is as an `application/octet-stream`

The workflow has two different paths, one where we get the mulitpart data by index and other where we loop over the data.
