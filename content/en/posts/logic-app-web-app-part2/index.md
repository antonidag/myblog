## Background
Last year I wrote an blog post about how Logic Apps Standard can be used to build an web application, you can find the blog [here](/posts/logic-app-web-app). But that was more or less a proof of concept, idea, is this really possible. I did not look into other layers that is typical needed in your web application, and how these requirements can be solved to meet a more of an enterprise level. So in this blog post we will explore different topics of an web application and how these can be solved with Azure Services! 

## Digesting a web application ðŸ’»
At its core, a web application is simply `HTML` and `JavaScript` code hosted on a web server. However, when you look deeper, you'll see that a web app consists of multiple technical components, such as:

- User Interface & Experience â€“ How users interact with the app.
- Frontend & Backend â€“ The logic driving both the visible and behind-the-scenes parts.
- Authentication & Authorization â€“ Who gets in and what they can do.
- Performance & Scalability â€“ Ensuring fast load times and handling increased traffic.
- Security â€“ Protecting against threats like DDoS attacks, XSS, and SQL injection.
- and so on...

All these elements must work together to create a fully functional web application. Deploying and managing a web app for users across different locations requires additional infrastructure and careful design.

It's worth noting that if you're building a cutting-edge web application, Logic App Standard may not be your first choice as a primary framework since there is some limitations. However, if you find a scenario where it fits, there are some key considerations that can help streamline the implementation and avoid some pitfalls.

## Architecture
Looking at it from a top-level perspective and working our way down, the entry point of the application will be __Azure Application Gateway__. From there, traffic will be routed to __Azure API Management__, and the final destination will be __Logic App Standard__ where most of implementation will happen.

Each layer and service plays an important role in this architecture:

- __Application Gateway__ acts as the entry point, functioning as both a firewall and load balancer. It ensures secure traffic management, enforcing domain rules, SSL certificates, and regional restrictions (e.g., allowing only EU traffic).

- __API Management__ handles API routing, authentication, and caching for optimized response times. It determines access based on user authentication and enforces security policies before requests reach the application layer if needed.

- __Logic App Standard__ serves as both the front-end and back-end of the application. It delivers `HTML` and `JavaScript` while also handling business logic. Static pages are *almost* directly served, while dynamic pages are generated and rendered by the server (SSR). 

This structured separation ensures security, efficiency, and scalabilityâ€”starting with secure traffic handling, followed by authentication and caching, and concluding with the application logic itself.

### Front-end & Back-end
Home page 
The concept of front-end and back-end still exists within this context. However, the lines are bit more blurry. But even modern framework like next.js utilize this kind of mixing front and back-ends into one application, some funcunallity runs on the server while other runs on client. The same principle can be applied here, it more or less a matter of how creative you want to be. The method I found to quite straight was to build that one page would be one workflow. 

Something about liquid  

### Routing
Correct routing is a big part of making this work
### Redirecting

### Authentication
Cookies are sent in the HTTP header, and they are domain specific. 
Best practice is to HTTP-only cookies

Cookies & APIM policy jwt 
### Performance 
Cache APIM internal/ Stateless / avoid to much complexity within liquid.
There is of course many ways to improve the page load, one example of this to utilizes the cache, is to load dynamic content as within iframes or embed tags. Is is because then html elements will be cache rather than the content.   
### Assets 
Dealing with assets is also a bit tricky since you can't do any direct pointing the server since it is a Logic App service, but the way you would do it is to in Azure expose a storage account on a specific path. Like domain.se/assets/**.img/jpg 

## Reflections

I think the most hassles you will have working with Logic Apps for a website is probably the routing since there is any direct integration between Azure API Management and Logic App Standard. 

The more and more I started to working on this I have realized that no matter which technology stack, framework you choose or method. Making a successful application requires a thought through architecture and it is actually less dependent on what platform you are using. Yes, ofcourse some things are easier to build while others are harder but in the end it is still the same issues you are trying to tackle. In some sense you are trying to create away to easily manipulate the html code while presenting content quickly. Like a Single Page Application is not a silver bullet solving every problem.
