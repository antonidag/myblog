## About Me
I am an integration developer with experience working with Azure and DigitalOcean. My technical expertise includes C# .Net, JavaScript, TypeScript, and SQL, with proficiency in both relational and document databases.

As a self-motivated and attentive team player, I approach challenges in a structured and efficient manner and strive to continually learn and grow as a professional. I believe in the power of collaboration and teamwork to achieve success.

Whether working on a solo project or as part of a larger team, I am always looking for ways to deliver top-quality results to my clients and colleagues.
